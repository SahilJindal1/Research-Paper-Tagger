Oftentimes, while submitting a research article to a conference, we are asked to tag the research tracks of our article. Students and novice researchers find it difficult to tag the appropriate tracks because of inexperience. To simplify this process, we propose to build a model named Research Paper Tagger (RPT) which automatically suggests tracks for the research papers, by looking at a combination of its title, abstract, and the names of its authors. We evaluate RPT on the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) conference. Realization of RPT is helpful in another way too. Every year, thousands of papers are submitted to various research conferences. The number of papers submitted have been on the rise in recent years, especially in AI conferences (3350 papers were submitted to ACL 2020). With these many papers being submitted, it becomes difficult to manually read the abstracts and assign the right reviewers. Conferences assign the appropriate reviewers based on the research tracks chosen by the submitter. RPT could be used for verifying these tagged tracks, specially in the case where the papers have been submitted and tagged by novice researchers. We built an RPT specifically for ACL. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no dataset of ACL papers, with their corresponding research tracks. So we created a new dataset by scraping the ACL website. Our dataset has ACL papers of the years 2019, 2020 and 2021, with their corresponding research track labels.
